For our bucket list app, we have added the main activity that uses recycler view to display our bucket list. There are two preloaded bucket list that we added using the arraylist. Then we added a floating action button to the main activity, that will navigate to the add activity layout. For all the activities, we have cleared the default action bar and added a custom toolbar with the activity name and TWU logo. On add activity, we have added a back button as well that will navigate to the main activity page. Add activity has fields for title, description, latitude, longitude and date. Clicking on the select date will give date picker dialog with current date and user will be able to select the date and it will displayed in the textview. There is a submit button as well which will send all the data to the main activity page, i.e the new input will be displayed in the recycler view. We have also made edit activity layout and we will add onClick method to the recyler view to open that activity in coming days. So the summary of the progress we have done:
1. Added recycler view and displayed dummy data. 
2. Floating button to add activity. 
3. User will be able to add new activity and it will be displayed in the main page. 
4. All layout files are made.
